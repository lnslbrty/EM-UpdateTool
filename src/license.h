"current state of the art to develop more complex software in such a way\n" \
"that error-free function is guaranteed under all application conditions.\n" \
"We therefore only assume liability in ensuring that the supplied software\n" \
"is suitable based on the description created or accepted by TQ on proper\n" \
"usage under the terms of this agreement.\n" \
"2. In the event of major and reproducible deviations of the software\n" \

"reasonable period of time or to provide a replacement shipment of the\n" \
"product.\n" \
"If, as part of the subsequent performance we have chosen by providing\n" \
"an error-free update or upgrade of the software, we do not succeed in\n" \
"remedying the major deviations in the software functionality which have\n" \
"occurred or to find a work-around in a reasonable period of time which\n" \
"allows you to properly use the software under the terms of this agreement,\n" \
"you can request a discount for the stipulated compensation or to withdraw\n" \
"from the agreement.\n" \
"Claims of you which go beyond this scope are excluded, if permitted by law.\n" \
"3. We do not assume any liability for minor deviations in the functionality of\n" \
"the software from the product description or specification.\n" \
"4. The warranty is for one year in so far as no longer warranty period is\n" \
"required by law and begins with the acceptance of the software by you or\n" \
"- if a formal acceptance is not planned or does not occur –\n" \
"after two weeks following the transfer at the latest.\n" \
"5. We provide no warranty and assume no liability beyond the scope of usage as\n" \
"mentioned §1 for the correct selection, application and use of the software.\n" \
"6. This particularly applies in the event of culpable use of unsuitable, in\n" \
"particular non-compatible hardware or data processing programs,\n" \
"modifications or enhancements of the software performed by you or by your\n" \
"request, culpable failure to perform regular data back-up and to other cases\n" \
"of culpable or negligent handling by you. If you should use the software\n" \
"outside of the stipulated scope of application, all warranty obligations and\n" \
"other liability are rendered invalid.\n" \
"7. The afore mentioned warranty or liability restrictions do not apply\n" \
"in instances of injuries affecting life, limb and health, liability covered\n" \
"under the scope of the Product Liability Law (Produkthaftungsgesetz),\n" \
"if a promised characteristic or guaranteed composition is lacking in the\n" \
