- switch to https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp if its "cleaner" and more usable?

- shrink Http.hpp (server is not needed afaik)
- port Http.hpp to HTTP/1.1 (chunked transport)
- Http.hpp uses Maps and Multimaps (What happens with multiple values per key e.g. multiple Set-Cookie's in one response?)

- update python mock (was developed against 1.5* and 2.* versions)
