TQ-Systems Software License Agreement Version 1.0.1

Copyright 2017 The TQ-Systems GmbH (TQ), D-82229 Seefeld. All Rights Reserved.
Permission to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this document is granted.

The software license is bound to the usage of the TQ-Systems hardware.
The software is classified as product-specific software.
The software is provided exclusively in machine-readable form (object code)

§1 Scope of Use and Usage Period
1. The rights to the TQ software – particularly the copyright as well as other
additional industrial property rights – remain exclusively with TQ and TQ is
entitled to them even in the event that the software was modified by you or
your company.
Apart from any expressly allowed duplication or transmission of the software
you are prohibited from using this software in a manner not in line with
this agreement.
2. The usage right only applies to the use of the software in direct
conjunction with the TQ-Systems hardware (product).
You are prohibited from using the software developed by us even without the
product in conjunction with other products.
Any transfer to third parties shall be bound by the provisions of this
agreement.
3. You are obligated to report any action which does not require approval in
terms of German Copyright Law (UrhG) to TQ in writing.
Outside of the scope of the cases indicated in German Copyright Law (UrhG),
you are not entitled to modify, reverse engineer or translate the software
or to remove components from it.
4. Each use of the software which goes beyond the scope of the previous
provision requires our written approval.
5. The right to assert damage claims is still reserved.
6. You are only authorized to sub-license the software in direct conjunction
with the TQ-Systems hardware (product).
7. You must also ensure that no more additional rights to the software are
granted to the third party than those to which you are entitled based on
this agreement.
8. In the event of a transfer of rights, you are obligated to transfer the
software and to destroy not transferred copies.

§2 Warranty; Liability
1. We make explicit reference to the fact that it is not possible with the
current state of the art to develop more complex software in such a way
that error-free function is guaranteed under all application conditions.
We therefore only assume liability in ensuring that the supplied software
is suitable based on the description created or accepted by TQ on proper
usage under the terms of this agreement.
2. In the event of major and reproducible deviations of the software
functionality from the product description or specification, we are
entitled to choose to either refund the purchase price paid by you or
to provide a subsequent performance in the form of a repair within a
reasonable period of time or to provide a replacement shipment of the
product.
If, as part of the subsequent performance we have chosen by providing
an error-free update or upgrade of the software, we do not succeed in
remedying the major deviations in the software functionality which have
occurred or to find a work-around in a reasonable period of time which
allows you to properly use the software under the terms of this agreement,
you can request a discount for the stipulated compensation or to withdraw
from the agreement.
Claims of you which go beyond this scope are excluded, if permitted by law.
3. We do not assume any liability for minor deviations in the functionality of
the software from the product description or specification.
4. The warranty is for one year in so far as no longer warranty period is
required by law and begins with the acceptance of the software by you or
- if a formal acceptance is not planned or does not occur –
after two weeks following the transfer at the latest.
5. We provide no warranty and assume no liability beyond the scope of usage as
mentioned §1 for the correct selection, application and use of the software.
6. This particularly applies in the event of culpable use of unsuitable, in
particular non-compatible hardware or data processing programs,
modifications or enhancements of the software performed by you or by your
request, culpable failure to perform regular data back-up and to other cases
of culpable or negligent handling by you. If you should use the software
outside of the stipulated scope of application, all warranty obligations and
other liability are rendered invalid.
7. The afore mentioned warranty or liability restrictions do not apply
in instances of injuries affecting life, limb and health, liability covered
under the scope of the Product Liability Law (Produkthaftungsgesetz),
if a promised characteristic or guaranteed composition is lacking in the
software or we assume culpability in the form of malicious intent or gross
negligence.

§3. Additional conditions
1. Redistributions must contain a verbatim copy of this document.
2. The TQ-Systems may revise this license from time to time.
Each revision is distinguished by a version number.
You may use this Software under terms of this license revision or
under the terms of any subsequent revision of the license.
